# SUMMARY_HIGH

## Alignment Snapshot
- Existing marketing site served by Vite/React at root; blog will mount at `/blog` via Astro.
- Deployment target is GitHub Pages subdomain `blog.automationarchitech.com` with canonical host `https://automationarchitech.com`.
- Astro blog must remain theme-agnostic with content collections powering Markdown/MDX posts.

## TODO
- [ ] Replace snapshot with finalized system overview diagram/description after implementation.
