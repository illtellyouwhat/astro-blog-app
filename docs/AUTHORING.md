# AUTHORING

## Current Understanding
- Content authors will use Markdown/MDX stored under `src/content/posts` with astro content collections.
- Images reside in `public/images` to align with performance and accessibility requirements.

## TODO
- [ ] Detail required front matter fields once schema is finalized.
- [ ] Provide MDX embed examples (code blocks, media, iframes).
- [ ] Document branch/PR process for publishing.
