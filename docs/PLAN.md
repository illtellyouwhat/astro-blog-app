# PLAN

## Alignment Report
- Blog lives at `/blog` while existing React app keeps `/` routes.
- Separate GitHub Pages deployment (Model A) for the blog; marketing site remains independent.
- Reference document `/mnt/data/astro_blog_pipeline_llm_reference_up_to_date.md` is missing; awaiting guidance or alternate path.
