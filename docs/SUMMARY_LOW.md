# SUMMARY_LOW

## Integration Notes
- Marketing SPA nav update required to surface `/blog` link without coupling builds.
- Astro blog must enforce `base: "/blog"` with `trailingSlash: "always"` to stay consistent with canonical policy.
- Pending verification against missing reference document for additional low-level constraints.

## TODO
- [ ] Document final file layout, routes, build outputs, and cross-repo touchpoints.
